        <p> I thought back to how my love for ancient Chinese culture began with Chinese seal engraving, a traditional art
          carved into stones. Within two square inches of stone, lives delicate calligraphy that originated thousands of
          years ago. Laboring over every line of ancient-style script in the stone, I carefully carved each line foursquare
           and straight. When I reached the corner of the stone, the lines had to be carved round to protect the stone’s
           original shape. Such complex processes also reflected the seal makers’ personality
           - integrity and tactfulness. This inspired me to ponder over the values of ancient handicraftsman.
           I want to live life guided by such principles and diligence.

        <h1> Amazons (Java)</h1>
        <p> The game of Amazons is a simple but rather interesting board game, usually for two players.
           It was invented in 1988 by Walter Zamkauskas of Argentina, and originally called El Juego de las Amazonas
           (now a trademark of Ediciones de Mente). The board is a 10 by 10 chessboard. Each player gets four "amazons"
            (represented as chess queens), white for the player who moves first, and black for the opponent.
